**Problem**  As a local coffee roaster grows, it's having trouble predicting how much to roast and when they should be delivering coffee to clients. Right now they operate on a fixed weekly schedule but if they had a better view into how their clients are using their coffee, they could be much more efficient.

**Solution** We'll create an easy to deploy "bean counter" device that is essentially a smart scale our roaster that you can give to clients. All of your client's coffee is stored on the industrial sensor and it wirelessly reports usage back to the roaster so they can see how fast coffee is being used, make better predictions about what they should roast, and deliver coffee exactly when their clients need it. Our connected scale has a maximum capacity of 80lbs.

**Degree of Difficulty (1-5): 4** This example requires some basic electrical knowledge and the ability to solder, but otherwise the project is appropriate for a novice.

### Other Applications
You may not be running a coffee company, but this project will be of interest to anyone who wants to remotely monitor inventory or environment, from tracking the volume of water in a tank to the humidity in a warehouse.

### What You'll Need
Before we get started, here's a quick overview of what you'll need to build the Industrial Sensor:

**Electronic Components** In order to build your own Industrial Sensor, you'll need the following items:
