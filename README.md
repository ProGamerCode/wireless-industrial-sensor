**Problem** As businesses grow, they often have trouble tracking their inventory or monitoring their storage or production environment. If they had a low-cost, reliable, and technical remote inventory monitoring solution, they could predict production needs and protect their products, increasing both efficiency and profits.

**Solution** We will create a Twilio-powered easy-to-deploy device to track and log relative humidity level, temperature, and weight. This project will be of interest to anyone who wants to remotely monitor inventory or environment.

**Degree of Difficulty (1-5): 2** This example requires some basic electrical knowledge but otherwise the project is appropriate for a novice.

### Other Applications
You may not be running a coffee company, but this project will be of interest to anyone who wants to remotely monitor inventory or environment, from tracking the volume of water in a tank to the humidity in a warehouse.

### What You'll Need
Before we get started, here's a quick overview of what you'll need to build the Industrial Sensor:

**Electronic Components** In order to build your own Industrial Sensor, you'll need the following items:

* 1x [Twilio Programmable Wireless SIM](https://www.twilio.com/wireless)
* 1x [Programmable Wireless Industrial Sensor shopping list](http://bit.ly/2wxubYC)

That's it! As a reminder, full instructions for this tutorial can be found in the [Industrial Sensor Blueprint](https://www.twilio.com/wireless/blueprints/industrial-sensor/).
