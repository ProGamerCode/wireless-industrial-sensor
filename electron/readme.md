# Industrial Sensor
### Build A Realtime Coffee Inventory Tracking
##### A partner Blueprint for [Particle Electron](https://www.particle.io)

This is the code that runs on the Electron 3G kit.  We have two versions of the code, [one that sends the data to ThingSpeak](electron_thingspeak.ino) and [one that sends the data to a custom endpoint](electron_custom.ino). The hardware setup and code to read the sensors is the same, the only difference is what we do with the data.  If this is one of your first projects we recommend starting with the ThingSpeak version since it's quick and easy.

For instructions on how to program your Electron, please see [this tutorial](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/electron/#logging-in). You will need to copy and paste the code we have provided into Electron's online IDE.
